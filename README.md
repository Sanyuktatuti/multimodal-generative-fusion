# ðŸŒŒ Multi-Modal Generative Fusion

**What it is**  
An experimental platform that transforms plain text into immersive 3D scenes with synchronized visuals, motion, and audio. Inspired by the next wave of generative AI (Sora, Gemini), the project explores how natural language can become a gateway to rich, interactive worlds.  

**Our Aim**  
The goal is to build a full-fledged cloud-hosted system where anyone can describe a scene in words and instantly experience it as a playable 3D environment, bridging creativity, accessibility, and cutting-edge multimodal AI.
